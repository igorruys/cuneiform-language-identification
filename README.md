# Cuneiform Language Identification

Final projetct of the UFRJ's Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. The objective was to use the theory acquired during the course in an original project.

The cuneiform script, conceived around 3200 B.C, is the first writting system created by man. This system was used by different peoples of Mesopotamia and the same characters could be used to encode different languages, which makes it difficult to study these texts. In this project, this problem is approached through the use of the ALBERT model capable of identifying the language/dialect of a given text written in cuneiform. The experiments are carried out with the dataset provided during the Cuneiform Language Identification 2019 competition.
